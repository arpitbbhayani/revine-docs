Given that the Revine is a visual language and everything revolves around drawing and moving objects on the Canvas

A point is referred to as a comma-separated co-ordinates `(x, y)` where `x` and `y` are both integers wrapped in round brackets. The top left corner of the canvas is `(0, 0)` while the bottom right is `(500, 500)`.

To refer to a point that is at `100` pixels to the right from `(0, 0)` and `200` pixels down, we use `(100, 200)`.

> Note: Brackets wrapping and comma separation are important and are part of the syntax.
