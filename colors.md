There is a set of predefined colors that you can choose to color your shape or canvas with. You can use the color by referring to it by the name, and here's the complete list.

| Name | Color | RGB |
|------------|----------------|-----------|
| `RED`  |  <div style="background: #FF0000; padding: 1em;" />  |  `#FF0000`  |
| `GREEN`  |  <div style="background: #00FF00; padding: 1em;" />  |  `#00FF00`  |
| `BLUE`  |  <div style="background: #0000FF; padding: 1em;" />  |  `#0000FF`  |
| `BLACK`  |  <div style="background: #000000; padding: 1em;" />  |  `#000000`  |
| `WHITE`  |  <div style="background: #FFFFFF; padding: 1em;" />  |  `#FFFFFF`  |

> Revine has deliberately not given the option to define color through the RGB combination or the HEX Code because the kids might not know about it.
